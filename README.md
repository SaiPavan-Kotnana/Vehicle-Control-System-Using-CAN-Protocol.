# Vehicle-Control-System-Using-CAN-Protocol.


Topic: Real-Time Vehicle Control System Using CAN Protocol (BCM)-LPC2129 ARM BOARD. 

Description: This project ensures seamless communication between two vehicle ECUs.This project aims to transfer messages from one node to another nodes using CAN protocols.The project was developed with the assumption of using basic car signals such as right indicator, left indicator, and headlight.

To achieve this, two Electronic Control Units (ECUs) ARM boards were used: one for the transmitter and one for the receiver. One will acts as BCM & another will acts as LCM. To BCM three switches are connected & LCM three LED are connected which will work as right indicator ,left indicator ,headlight and Alphanumeric display this is a 2x16 LCD it will display the CGRAM symbol on screen.The hardware used in this project includes ARM boards and Alphanumeric display while the software used is Embedded C and CAN protocol.
